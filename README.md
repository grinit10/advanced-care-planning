## 🚀 Quick Start (~30-45 minutes)

### What You'll Need

| Requirement | Where to Get It |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Docker Desktop** (free) | https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/ |
| **Azure account** (free) | https://portal.azure.com (get $200 AUD free credits) |
| **A microphone** | Built into most laptops |

**That's it. No Python. No Node.js. No coding.**

> ⏱️ **Time breakdown:** Docker Desktop install (~10 min first time) + Azure OpenAI setup (~15 min) +
> Deepgram setup (~5 min) + config (~5 min) + docker build (~3-5 min). Already have Docker and cloud
> accounts? You'll be up in ~5 minutes.

---

### Step 1: Install Docker Desktop

1. Go to https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
2. Click the **"Download for Windows"** button (or Mac/Linux)
3. Open the downloaded file and follow the installation wizard
4. After installation, open **Docker Desktop** from your Start menu
5. Wait until you see **"Engine running"** in the bottom-left corner

> ⏳ This might take a few minutes the first time. Docker Desktop needs to start its virtual machine.

---

### Step 2: Set Up Azure OpenAI

You need an Azure OpenAI resource with 3 models deployed. Follow these steps:

#### 2a. Create an Azure OpenAI Resource

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com and sign in
2. In the top search bar, type **"Azure OpenAI"** and select it
3. Click **"+ Create"** → **"Azure OpenAI"**
4. Fill in the form:
   - **Subscription**: Select your subscription
   - **Resource group**: Click **"Create new"** → type **`acp-rg`**
   - **Region**: Select **"Australia East"** (Sydney — lowest latency for Australian users, and all required models are available)
   - **Name**: Type **`acp-openai`**
   - **Pricing tier**: **Standard S0**
5. Click **"Next"** → **"Next"** → **"Create"**
6. Wait for deployment to finish (1-2 minutes) → click **"Go to resource"**

#### 2b. Deploy Models

1. In your OpenAI resource page, click **"Explore"** (or **"Go to Azure AI Foundry"**)
2. Azure AI Foundry opens in a new tab. Click **"Deployments"** on the left
3. Click **"Create new deployment"** and deploy these 3 models one at a time:

   | Model | Deployment Name | Purpose |
   |-------|----------------|---------|
   | **gpt-4.1-mini-aus** | `gpt-4.1-mini-aus` | The brain (conversation) |

   > **STT & TTS are handled by Deepgram (not Azure OpenAI).**
   > See [Step 2d](#setup-deepgram-for-stt-and-tts) below.

   For each model:
   - Select the model from the dropdown
   - Type the **Deployment Name** exactly as shown above
   - Click **"Create"**

#### 2c. Copy Your Keys

1. Go back to the Azure portal tab (not AI Foundry)
2. You should still be in your `acp-openai` resource page
3. On the left menu, click **"Keys and Endpoint"**
4. Copy **Key 1** (click the copy icon)
5. Copy the **Endpoint** URL (looks like `https://acp-openai.openai.azure.com`)

> 💡 **Australia East tip:** Hosting your OpenAI resource in Sydney means lower latency for Australian users. Your data is processed in Australia and stays within Australian borders for the AI processing step.

---

### Step 2d: Set Up Deepgram for STT and TTS

Speech-to-text and text-to-speech are handled by **Deepgram**, not Azure OpenAI. Deepgram has an Australian endpoint (`api.au.deepgram.com`) running on AWS Sydney — your voice data stays in Australia.

1. Go to https://console.deepgram.com and sign up (free tier includes 200 minutes/month)
2. Go to **"API Keys"** in the left menu
3. Click **"Create a new API Key"**, give it a name (e.g. `acp-agent`), and copy the key
4. You'll add this key to your `.env` file in the next step

### Step 3: Download and Configure the Project

#### Option A: Download ZIP
1. Go to the GitHub repository page
2. Click **"Code"** → **"Download ZIP"**
3. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer

#### Option B: Git Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-REPO/advanced-care-planning.git
cd advanced-care-planning
```

#### Create the .env File

1. In the project folder, you'll see a file named **`.env.example`**
2. Make a copy of it and rename the copy to **`.env`** (remove the `.example` part)
3. Open the `.env` file in **Notepad** (right-click → Open with → Notepad)
4. It should look like this:

```ini
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-10-01-preview
AZURE_OPENAI_LLM_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4.1-mini-aus
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-deepgram-api-key-here
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=devkey
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=devsecret
```

5. Replace these values with what you copied in Step 2c:
   - Replace `https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com` with your **Endpoint**
   - Replace `your-api-key-here` with your **Key 1**
6. **Save the file** (Ctrl+S) and close Notepad

---

### Step 4: Start Everything

#### Windows (Easy Way)
Double-click the **`scripts/setup.ps1`** file. Or open a terminal:

```powershell
cd C:\Path\To\advanced-care-planning
docker compose up -d
```

#### Mac / Linux (Easy Way)
Run the setup script:
```bash
cd /path/to/advanced-care-planning
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

Or directly with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

> ⏳ **First time only:** This downloads and builds all the Docker images. It may take 3-5 minutes.
> Subsequent starts will be instant.

#### Check That Everything Is Running

```bash
docker compose ps
```

You should see all 5 services with status "Up":

| Service | Status |
|---------|--------|
| redis | Up |
| livekit-server | Up |
| token-server | Up |
| agent | Up |
| frontend | Up |

---

### Step 5: Talk to the AI

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to **http://localhost:5173**
3. Type your name in the box
4. Click **"Start Conversation"**
5. When your browser asks for microphone permission, click **"Allow"**
6. **Start speaking!** The AI will guide you through your care planning

> 💡 **Tips:**
> - Speak clearly at a normal pace
> - Wait for the AI to finish responding before speaking
> - You can interrupt the AI at any time
> - Your conversation transcript is displayed on screen

---

### Step 6: When You're Done

To stop everything:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To restart later:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

---

## 🤔 How It Works

1. You speak into your browser's microphone
2. Audio is sent to the **LiveKit server** (running on your computer)
3. The **Voice Agent** receives the audio:
   - **VAD** (Voice Activity Detection) finds where your speech starts and ends
   - **Deepgram STT** (Nova-3, via `api.au.deepgram.com`) converts your speech to text
   - **Azure OpenAI LLM** generates a thoughtful response about ACP
   - **Deepgram TTS** (Aura, via `api.au.deepgram.com`) converts the response text to natural-sounding speech
4. You hear the AI's response through your speakers
5. The conversation transcript appears on the screen

**Your data flows: Browser → LiveKit → Agent → Deepgram (STT) → Azure OpenAI (LLM) → Deepgram (TTS) → Agent → LiveKit → Browser**
**Audio and text transit through cloud services in real-time but are not stored by them.**

## 🇦🇺 Australian ACP Context

### Why This Matters in Australia

Advanced Care Planning helps you document your preferences for future healthcare — so your voice is heard even if you can't speak for yourself. In Australia:

- **1 in 3 Australians** over 65 will need someone else to make healthcare decisions for them
- **Each state and territory** has its own ACP laws and forms (NSW, VIC, QLD, WA, SA, TAS, ACT, NT)
- An **Advance Care Directive** is the legal document that records your wishes
- A **Substitute Decision-Maker** (also called Medical Enduring Power of Attorney in some states) is the person you appoint to make decisions on your behalf
- Your GP, specialist, or local hospital can help you formalise your directive

### What This AI Covers

The conversation guides you through:
- Choosing a **Substitute Decision-Maker** (who you trust to speak for you)
- Documenting your **values and beliefs** about healthcare
- Specifying your preferences for **life-sustaining treatment**
- Outlining your **quality of life** thresholds
- Providing guidance for **end-of-life care** that aligns with your values

> ⚠️ **Important:** This tool helps you *think through and articulate* your preferences. It does **not** create legally binding documents. After your conversation, we recommend formalising your wishes with an official Advance Care Directive through your state or territory's health department. You can find state-specific forms at [advancecareplanning.org.au](https://www.advancecareplanning.org.au).

### State and Territory Resources

### Components

| Component | Role | Technology |
|-----------|------|------------|
| **Frontend** | Web UI with microphone access | React + TypeScript + Vite |
| **LiveKit Server** | WebRTC media routing | Go (LiveKit) |
| **Redis** | Agent dispatch queue | Redis 7 |
| **Voice Agent** | AI pipeline: VAD → STT → LLM → TTS | Python (LiveKit Agents) |
| **Token Server** | Generates LiveKit access tokens | Python (aiohttp) |
| **Azure OpenAI** | LLM (conversation brain) | Cloud API (Australia East) |
| **Deepgram** | STT (Nova-3) + TTS (Aura-2) via Australian endpoint | Cloud API (AWS Sydney) |

### Data Flow (One Conversation Turn)

1. User speaks → browser mic → WebRTC audio → **LiveKit Server**
2. Agent receives audio → **Silero VAD** detects speech boundaries
3. Audio segments → **Deepgram STT** (Nova-3, via `api.au.deepgram.com`) → text transcript
4. Transcript → **Azure OpenAI LLM** (GPT-4.1-mini-aus, with ACP prompt) → response text
5. Response text → **Deepgram TTS** (Aura-2, via `api.au.deepgram.com`) → synthesised audio stream
6. Audio → LiveKit Server → WebRTC → user hears response

### Data Residency

- **LiveKit, Redis, Agent, Frontend**: Run on your local machine. No data leaves your computer.
- **Deepgram STT/TTS**: Voice data is sent to `api.au.deepgram.com` (AWS Sydney, ap-southeast-2). All audio stays in Australia. No data is stored — processed in real-time and discarded.
- **Azure OpenAI (LLM)**: When using **Australia East**, your text data is processed in Australian data centres in Sydney. No data is stored by Azure OpenAI — it is processed in real-time and discarded.

## 🛠 Development Guide

### Running the Agent Locally (Without Docker)

```bash
cd agent
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the agent (LiveKit must be running via docker compose)
python -m agent.main
```

### Running the Frontend Locally (Without Docker)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Customising the Conversation Prompt

The AI's conversation style and topics are defined in **`agent/prompt.yaml`** — an easy-to-edit plain text file. You can change the tone, add or remove questions, or completely redesign the conversation flow.

**To customise:**
1. Open `agent/prompt.yaml` in any text editor
2. Edit the text under `prompt: |` — the vertical bar means everything indented below it is the prompt
3. Save the file
4. Rebuild the agent: `docker compose build agent && docker compose up -d agent`

**What you can change:**
- The AI's personality and tone
- The conversation phases and topics
- Specific questions asked
- Medical or ethical guidelines
- Language, cultural references, or terminology (e.g. Australian-specific healthcare terms)

**What is locked (do not modify):**
- The `TTS Output Rules` section is appended automatically by the code. These rules ensure the AI's responses sound natural when spoken by Azure OpenAI TTS. They cannot be edited through the YAML file.

**Prompt reloading:** The prompt is loaded once when the agent starts. After editing `prompt.yaml`, you must restart the agent (`docker compose restart agent`).

### Rebuilding After Changes

```bash
# Rebuild a specific service
docker compose build agent
docker compose up -d agent

# Or rebuild everything
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "Docker Engine is not running"
- Open **Docker Desktop** from your Start menu
- Wait for the green "Engine running" indicator
- Run the script again

### "Connection Error" in the browser
- Make sure all services are running: `docker compose ps`
- Check the agent logs: `docker compose logs agent`
- Verify your `.env` file has the correct Azure OpenAI credentials

### No audio / Can't hear the AI
- Check your browser's microphone permission (look for a mic icon in the address bar)
- Make sure your speakers are on and not muted
- Try using Chrome or Edge (some browsers handle WebRTC better)

### "Agent not registered" in logs
- Wait a few seconds — the agent connects to LiveKit on startup
- Check Redis is running: `docker compose logs redis`

### Need Help?
- Open an issue on the GitHub repository
- Include the output of: `docker compose logs --tail=50 agent`
